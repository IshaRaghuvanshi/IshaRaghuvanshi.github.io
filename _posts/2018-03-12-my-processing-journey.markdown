When I created my first dot with the help of processing it gave me a sense of accomplishment, by the end of the class I could make colourful lines, different kinds of shapes, and different movements very easily, it all seemed impossible at first but with time things started falling in place, today was the first class which ended up with many interesting designs and a severe headache, because obviously it is not easy to learn a new language but the curiosity of learning and knowing how to create all the fun and interesting combinations myself kept me and all my classmates going.
