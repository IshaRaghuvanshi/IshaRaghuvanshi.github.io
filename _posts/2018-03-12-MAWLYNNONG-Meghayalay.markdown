Mawlynnong is the first on this list for all right reasons, from being the cleanest village of Asia to being called as god’s old garden.

Mawlynnong is situated on the eastern Khasi Ghats of Meghalaya, along the India-Bangladesh border with a mere population of 600 people.
Use of polythene bags and smoking is prohibited here, on the other hand waste is collected in dustbins made of bamboo and is further directed to a pit and then used as manure, all the residents of the village are encouraged and taught about cleanliness from a very young age.
Along with that there are 99 households in the village according to the 2014 census, all of them having rain water harvesting systems compulsorily. Not just that the village has a literacy rate of 100%.

Leaving behind the patriarchal rule of the society, the Khasi tribe has set an example for the world, here the new born child takes its mothers second name, and the right of property is passed on to the youngest daughter of the family from her mother.
The Maylynnong root bridges are declared as the UNESCO world heritage sight, these Ariel bridges are created by joining the hanging roots of one tree to another.

The weather in Mawlynnong is pleasant all through the year. Still the best time to visit Mawlynnong, is the monsoons. During the rainy season, village becomes lush green and you can click some amazing pictures.
You can also visit it during festive times – Behdienkhlam in July, Wangala – between September to December, and Nongkrem Dance Festival in October or November are some of the main festivals celebrated by the Khasi tribes in and near Mawlynnong Village.
The village is not commercialised yet and therefore you wont find any hotels in or near the village but you will find many homestays here which will help you understand the normal life of people closely and you will get to experience the best of this place.
Mawlynnong is well connected to major cities like shilling and Cherrapunji the roads are in a very good condition the nearest airport is Shillong which is 78 km away, whereas Guwahati railway station 172 km being the closest, you will easily find buses and taxis running on this route.
One should visit this location atleast once in life. May this monsoon be a Mawlynnong one.
